    <Section title="The hole-filling pathway is patching, not teaching" accent={C.red}>
      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>When a student scores 60–89% on a test-out, they receive MobyMax lessons only for the specific questions they missed. This creates two problems: the lessons are narrow (a student might practice one main idea question and pass it, but that doesn't build the deeper skill), and gaps only get caught if the test happens to expose them. If a student guesses correctly on a character traits question, the gap goes undetected until a harder test surfaces it.</p>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Mastering a MobyMax lesson ≠ mastering the skill" accent={C.amb}>
      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>Only 19% of gaps (21 of 112) involve skills students had genuinely mastered before testing — and those are concentrated in just Pablo Cortazar (13) and Ethan Bale (5), plus 2 from Anthem Thomas and 1 from Aiden Richardson. MobyMax has high mastery standards with remediation until mastered, so these students genuinely demonstrated the skill. Yet they couldn't apply it on the test. The "forgot" skills are primarily Answer questions about key details, Use context clues, Identify Main Topic, and Identify Main Idea in Paragraph. These skills require spaced retrieval — repeated active recall across varied contexts over time. MobyMax teaches skills in isolation; the test assesses them within full reading passages.</p>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Ethan Bale is the curriculum red flag" accent={C.pur}>
      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>As the only student who completed the full course (End of Course, Reading 2.7) and still scored 53.3%, Ethan's 8 "never learned" gaps represent genuine curriculum deficiencies. His biggest gaps — Answer questions about key details (3 misses), Identify Main Topic (2 misses) — suggest the Grade 2 curriculum may not adequately build informational text comprehension. His results should be investigated separately from the test-out students.</p>

    <Section title="Some skills are fragile regardless of pathway" accent={C.acc}>
      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>Use an events sequence map appears in both categories almost equally (5 never learned, 6 forgot). Identify Main Topic shows 5 never learned and 4 forgot. A one-time lesson is not enough for these skills — they need ongoing reinforcement regardless of whether a student went through the full course or the hole-filling path.</p>

    <Section title="Streamlining creates a testing misalignment" accent={C.red}>
      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>Seven skill gaps were intentionally not assigned to students because they were considered redundant ("Streamlined"). The most common: <strong style={{color:C.txt}}>Identify Main Idea in Paragraph</strong> (4 students) and <strong style={{color:C.txt}}>Identify Characters</strong> (3 students). Yet students are still being assessed on these exact skills. If a skill is streamlined out of the hole-filling pathway, it should either be removed from the test or the streamlining decision should be revisited.</p>

    <Section title="Alternatives work — but transfer is incomplete" accent={C.amb}>
      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>In 16 cases, students mastered a related alternative skill (e.g., "Identify Character's Feelings" instead of "Identify Character Traits," or "Identify the problem and solution" instead of "Identify Main Topic"). This shows students are learning the underlying concepts — but the test asks the question in a different format. The gap may be less about knowledge and more about how flexibly students can apply what they know across different question types.</p>

      <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.8,margin:0}}>If students keep passing grades without completing full courses, they will eventually hit a wall because knowledge gaps build up. At these early ages, building solid foundations is essential. Tests require 90% accuracy to pass — but even a student who passes with exactly 90% still has a 10% gap that carries forward. For students who score 60–89%, the gap is even larger, and they only receive hole-filling for the specific questions they missed — not comprehensive coverage of the underlying skills. When these students eventually pass and move on, they carry unfilled gaps into the next grade. The 10 of 14 students who entered Grade 2 testing with zero pre-test mastery on the skills they missed demonstrate this clearly: they had no foundation to build on, and the test exposed it.</p>

        <p style={{color:C.mut,fontSize:13,lineHeight:1.7,margin:0}}>Test-outs should only be available for students whose age grade is more than 1 year above their current content (knowledge) grade — meaning they are behind and need to accelerate. For students who are at or near grade level, require them to complete the full course through Grade 2.
